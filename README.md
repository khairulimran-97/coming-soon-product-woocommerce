# WordPress Admin Tool for Hiding "Add to Cart" Button

This WordPress plugin provides an admin interface for administrators to select specific products and categories for which the "Add to Cart" button will be hidden on the front-end, effectively preventing customers from making purchases on these products. This can be useful when you want to showcase products that are "Coming Soon" or not currently available for purchase.

## Features

- **Admin Page**: Adds an admin menu page that allows administrators to manage the list of products and categories for which the "Add to Cart" button will be hidden.
- **Product Selection**: Administrators can select individual products and entire categories to hide the "Add to Cart" button.
- **Date Selection**: Administrators can specify a launching date for the products, which can be displayed alongside the hidden products to inform customers about their availability.

## Usage

1. After activating the plugin, a new menu item named "Comming Soon" will appear in the WordPress admin menu.
2. Click on the "Comming Soon" menu item to access the admin page for managing "Coming Soon" products.
3. Select individual products or entire categories from the respective multi-select dropdowns to hide the "Add to Cart" button for those items.
4. Optionally, set a launching date for each product to inform customers when the products will be available for purchase.
5. Click the "Save Selection" button to save your changes. A success message will be displayed using SweetAlert2.
